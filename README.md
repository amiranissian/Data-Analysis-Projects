#### I received sales data for Contoso during January, February, and March. In this report, I will try to explain some outputs of this data via some graphs and create an overview of the data. In the table below, we can observe EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).I checked the company's data and you can find the results in the [Report](https://github.com/amiranissian/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Data%20mining%20by%20Excel_report.pdf).
